# dreamland-blog

## Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application created for myself and a friend to log & compare our dreams. It features a dual narrative layout where dreams are displayed side by side on a vertical timeline. The front end is implemented using pure CSS and JavaScript since the small scale of the project does not necessitate more complex frameworks. Google OAuth is used for user authentication, and SQLite is used to store blog posts and user data. 

## Getting Started
This blog application can be adapted for other dual narrative projects or as a template for individual blogs.
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary Python packages (Flask, OAuth libraries, etc.).
3. Run app.py to start the Flask server.
4. Access the blog through your preferred web browser.
Feel free to adapt this project to your needs, whether for personal use or as a template for a different type of dual-narrative blog.
